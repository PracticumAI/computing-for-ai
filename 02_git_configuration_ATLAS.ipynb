Some code blocks are long, and you probably won't undestand everything, though you can probably follow what is happening if your read the comments and code. If you would rather not run code that you don't understand, for each step there are also alternative step-by-step instructions for running a few commands on the Linux, or Bash, Command Line. Again, you may not understand those, though we provide links to GitHub's explanation and our own explanations.\n"
